- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, backend with Java / Spring Boot and Natural Language Processing.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying web development, learning new stuff and refreshing my knowledge on topics of the three fundamental technologies – HTML, CSS and Javascript. I like to play with programming in general, but I know mostly Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email address.
